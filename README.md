Fortunes Line Sweep
===================

My project is an animation of Fortune's line sweep algorithm for computing voronoi diagrams.

By clicking on the animate sweep line you activate the line sweep animation.
You can also click on the canvas and drag the sweep line in order to view the state of the algorthm at different points of the sweep line.

In order to create this animation many geometric computations were performed.
